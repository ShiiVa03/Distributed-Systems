# Distributed Systems Project

Airline reservation class project to understand the main principles of distributed systems. The main goal was to create an airline reservation system that could handle multiple clients making a reservation. It also supports the administrator role that can insert and delete flights and change their capacity. Clients can make layovers and the system will verify if the flights capacities are available.

# Structure

We used RPC structure providing the client the abstraction to communicate with the server. The language used to develop this project was Java.
